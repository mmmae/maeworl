                            ...website<br><br>

                            YEEEEEEEEEE! apparently I'm suddenly very focused on a project or task
                            if I apologise about being slow with it. I don't know, I just made that
                            post the other day, and right away shat out the whole website in under a week.
                            I do not know what is up with me but OK. yeah. website is updated, all fresh and comfy,
                            and currently javascript-free (ü§Ø) and back to PNGs for older device compatibility, cause someone should be able to
                            view lewd furry drawings on their homebrew PSVita or 3DS if they wanna ü•∫<br><br>

                            new things on the website include:<br>
                            &bull; a new archive grouped by year, with more obvious indicators of each image's license<br>
                            &bull; the whole site is now completely accessible without javascript ü§Ø truly static..<br>
                            &bull; updated character references pages. also woah, you can actually see avril's and dairy's deets now!<br>
                            &bull; cool little frontpage news section, featuring various update posts I've made over the years. yeh<br>
                            &bull; RSS feed! have a cool way of knowing when the latest drawing drops!<br>
                            &bull; A lovely new character selection page, inspired by an old version of the website!<br><br>

                            there's probably more stuff that got added that I've forgotten, but yeah, that about
                            covers the main chunks. pardon if my writing's all goofy, I definitely think I need to rest..
                            new drawing should drop soon, you can see a flat version of it used as M√ºll's new reference image if you take a look!<br><br>

                            I'll work on any quick fixes for the site as I spot any goofs, but it seems relatively okay and responsive across most things!<br>
                            Feel free to give feedback and recommendations, I'll see what I can end up sorting out, yeye. I've also got secret plans for another thing
                            on there, but you'll have to wait a while on that üôä

                        <p>
                            ayo, still drawing things, but I'm definitely getting
                            a little bored of it all, I gotta admit. a break wouldn't
                            do anything for me though considering I already take
                            it easy, yeh, just gotta, get all hype about art
                            stuffs again somehow<br><br>
                            
                            obviously at this point I'm off of twitter, I enjoyed
                            peeps on there but yeah, couldn't stand what was
                            happening to the platform, not to mention who runs it.
                            it's a lot quieter daily now <br><br>

                            <img src="/img/home/poasts/20230917-bored-a.png" alt="A witch cat at tummy level, holding some vials with dubious contents." loading="lazy">
                            <img src="/img/home/poasts/20230917-bored-b.png" alt="A witch cat in ecstasy. She stares at nothing, thinks nothing. Head empty." loading="lazy"><br><br>
                            
                            anyways, got a fresh M√ºll witch drip design coming out
                            soon since her outfit could do with an update (and people
                            seem over the village tracht for now), as for design
                            changes, at most you'll see me giving her the digitigrade
                            feets from now on, hands staying the same. there will
                            be some cool lore explaining the new attire, but I need
                            to work out where to put that, and how I want to express
                            it (I've been pondering a bit of an origins comic for
                            her, but it's another big project for me that I might
                            end up dropping, and that's not cool to do over and over,
                            for you or for my brain)<br><br>
                            
                            uh, website development is pretty stalled, honestly. I'm
                            sort of directionless with what I wanna do with it,
                            whether I wanna switch hosts, keep it as a static site
                            still, and if so, whether or not I want to make it
                            reliant on JavaScript still like it is now. whatever
                            I go with, it means some more work since I'll need
                            to start from scratch yet again, avoiding getting
                            disinterested before finishing, which is very Freaking
                            hard for my "enjoys starting but not finishing projects daily"
                            brain. it's also a bit difficult to have a dev
                            environment for it all if I keep making new works at
                            the same time, or wanting to change ideas midway,
                            or want to redo a character's reference while I'm
                            already working on a reference page üòµ‚Äçüí´ ouhg<br><br>
                            
                            yeh, tis about all that's happening with me at the moment,
                            my partner's been a real sweetie, and I've been enjoying a
                            lot of time with him and his friends (that are now my
                            friends too), yeyeye, drawing's become pretty secondary.
                            currently working on saving for a new desktop rig,
                            will help when I've got a real chonker of a canvas open,
                            but also..... It'll let me finally play video game from
                            the past 4 years at a decent speed ü§Ø
                            
                            hope y'all have been well, been doing my best to keep
                            active on all the places I'm on, though I'm sorry I
                            haven't been doing the sketch posting, I've finally
                            gotten comfy with full works again, so that's my focus now, yee

                            kinda but also mainly there's an archive on there of all of my art,
                            including stuff prior to 2020 that some people will recognise...
                            There's also an FAQ section for questions i have frequently gotten,
                            self-explanatory, and a WIP Oh and there's a characters section,
                            where I'm currently working on each character's page. I've already
                            finished M√ºll's page, so you're able to check that out now if
                            you ever wanted a more detailed reference page on drawing her<br><br>
                            
                            Finally, the archive on there is the coolest part, the webhost
                            I'm using only allows static sites, so with some JavaScript
                            I was able to whip up a gallery sorta thing, where you can
                            load up full lossless images by just clicking on the relevant
                            thumbnail. Blah blah arrow key navigation too if one of your
                            hands is too busy for anything else üëÄ uploads will be done
                            to the archive first, with RSS feed implementation coming
                            soon, because it's been several months and I really wanted
                            to get something up at this point lol check it out if you'd
                            like! might be a little slow initially, both because of recent
                            file changes but also because my webhost is kinda slow atm<br><br>
                            
                            oh and if you have a twitter account (im Sorry), be sure to follow
                            me on there for the latest news about things and sketches of upcoming
                            stuff! ok buh bye

                            this halloween, we join a bored and horny M√ºll in her attempts
                            to summon spirits for getting freaky with.<br><br>

                            despite conjuring spirits in a graveyard, she doesn't bother
                            facing the graves. this leads to her repeating the ritual
                            more times than she likely intended...<br><br>

                            you can access this comic from the comics section of the <a href="/archive">archive</a>.
