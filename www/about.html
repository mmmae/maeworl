                <p>
                    hey fuck you loser
                </p>
    
                <h3>why is müll called müll? do you know that it means "trash" in german?</h3>
                <p>
                    yes, i knew that. here are the reasons:<br><br>
    
                    <strong>the lore reason:</strong> müll was named by her mother, a powerful witch who resided in south-west germany.
                    her mother was seeking to finish her biggest project yet, a one-of-a-kind transformation brew that would turn
                    any feral creature placed into it into an anthropomorphic being, which had never been done in this world.
                    to accomplish this, she had to go through a few dozen cats and a few dozen batches of transformation brew.
                    while the first few cats were given proper names, she found herself getting frustrated at failed concoctions which killed the cats
                    involved. later, cats in the experimentation process were then given swears and various harsh descriptors as names in the midst of this frustration.
                    finally, the last cat, müll (meaning rubbish), was chucked into the final brew. with a bright light and explosion, this last brew was successful.
                    müll's cool with the name, and does miss her mother, who created her and died shortly after because of witch hunters nearby.<br><br>
    
                    <strong>the real reason:</strong> wanted to make furry creacher and was learning german at the time and picked a random word
                </p>
